# sti-object-upgrade 
##Created 4/28/16
This repository contains two separate approaches to the problem. The first one, STI Object Upgrade, reworks the original
STI Challenge so that the individual employee arrays are now objects. But this program's main function does NOT
return an object to the console.log. It returns an array, like the original STI Challenge.
The second program, STI Object Upgrade with New Objects, returns an object to the console.log instead of an array.
###Files for the first approach are: index.html and sti-object-upgrade.js
###Files for the second approach are: index-with-new-objects.html and sti-object-upgrade-with-new-objects.js
